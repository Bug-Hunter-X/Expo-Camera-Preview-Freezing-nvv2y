# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo Camera component.  The camera preview intermittently freezes, without any clear error messages in the console. This makes debugging challenging due to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

The exact steps to reproduce this bug consistently are currently unknown.  It appears to be related to resource contention or a timing issue, but further investigation is needed.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the camera's lifecycle, ensuring proper release of resources and implementing error handling, although a root cause is not clearly identified and the solution is still under development.

## Further Investigation

More investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of this intermittent freezing behavior. Possible areas to explore:

*   Memory management within the Expo Camera component.
*   Potential race conditions or timing issues.
*   Compatibility with specific devices or Expo SDK versions.
